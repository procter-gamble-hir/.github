# :lock: P&G Restricted Organization

This is P&G's organization for HiR code and related initiatives only.

Everything else, code should be in: [Main P&G GitHub Organization](github.com/procter-gamble)

Base rules in this organization:
- All repositories are PRIVATE.
- Access requests require B4+ approval OR P&G employee delegated by B4+
- Integrations only to systems that are HiR approved. Check LeanIX to validate.
